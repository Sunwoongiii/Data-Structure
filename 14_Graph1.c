/*
Starting at any vertex, going through each edge exactly once and terminating at the start vertex iff the degree of each vertex is even. 

A graph G consists of two sets, V and E.
V: vertices
E: set of pairs of vertices, these pairs are called edges. 
V(G) and E(G) represent the sets of vertices and edges of G
G = (V, E)

Graph with self loops: A graph that has an edge from a vertex, v, back to itself
MultiGraph: A graph allowing multiple edges between a pair of nodes
Complete Graph: A graph with n vertices has exactly n(n-1)/2 edges

(u,v): vertices u and v are adjacent. Edge(u,v) is incident on vertices u and v.
<u,v>: u is adjacent to v, and v is adjacent from u.
